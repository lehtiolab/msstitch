# Changelog

## [2.7] - 2018-04-19
### Change
- Field outputs for peptable and prottable merge - used to keep set-fields together and interleave isobaric channels with their nr of psms.
  Now values are kept together S1-qvalue, S2-qvalue, S1-intensity, S2-intensity. Isobaric channels are no longer interleaved, kept in groups of the multiplex amount,
  and the nr of PSM groups follow at the very end.

### Fixed
- Bug where it tried to remove a dummy field from a list of NA
- Bug in removing `(pre=,post=)`, new regex

## [2.6] - 2018-03-15

### Added
- This changelog :)
- Ion injection time is now parsed from the mzML files and stored in the PSM table

### Changed
- Better, more thorough stripping of `(pre=,post=)` string from MSGF entries in peptide table. Useful eg when such are already in shoddy FASTA headers

### Fixed
- Strip also negative weight modifications from peptides when needing the unmodified sequence
